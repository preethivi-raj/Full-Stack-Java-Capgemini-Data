            <h2>Introduction :</h2>
            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was first developed by Sun Microsystems
                in the mid-1990s, now owned by Oracle Corporation. It's designed to be platform-independent, which means
                that Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
                installed. This is commonly referred to as the "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.</p>

            <h2>JVM : </h2>
            <p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an integral part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It is the
                engine that enables Java programs to run on any device or operating system by providing a
                platform-independent execution environment. Essentially, the JVM abstracts the underlying hardware and
                operating system, allowing Java code to be executed uniformly across different platforms. <br> In simple
                terms, the JVM takes Java bytecode (which is platform-independent) and converts it into machine code
                that is specific to the host machineâ€™s architecture. This is why Java is often referred to as a "write
                once, run anywhere" language.</p>

            <h2>JDK : </h2>
            <p>The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development kit provided by Oracle (and others like
                Adoptium) for developing Java applications. It includes everything you need to write, compile, and run
                Java programs, making it a fundamental tool for any Java developer.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>JRE :</h2>
            <p>The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package that provides the necessary environment to run
                Java applications. It contains the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the core Java libraries, and other
                components that are required to execute Java programs. <br> While the Java Development Kit (JDK) is used
                for developing Java applications (since it includes the compiler and other tools for development), the
                JRE is intended for running Java applications on a machine where development is not needed.</p>

            <h2>Java Variables : </h2>
            <p>In Java, a variable is a container that holds data that can be used or modified during the execution of a
                program. Variables are essential to store values such as numbers, text, or other types of data.</p>
            <h3>Key Points About Variables in Java</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b> Variable Declaration:</b> A variable must be declared with a type before it can be used. The
                    declaration defines the type of data the variable can store (such as integer, string, etc.) and its
                    name.</li>
                <li> <b>Data Types: </b> Java has primitive and reference data types. The type of a variable determines
                    what kind of data it can hold.</li>
                <li> <b> Variable Scope: </b>The scope of a variable refers to where in the program it can be accessed.
                    For example, a local variable can only be accessed within the method or block where it is declared.
                </li>
                <li> <b> Initialization: </b> A variable must be initialized with a value before it can be used (except
                    for instance variables, which get a default value in certain cases).</li>
            </ul>
